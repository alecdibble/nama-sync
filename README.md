# nama-sync
Sync utility for nama - store your aliases in the cloud

## Why are nama & nama-sync seperate packages?

Security and flexibility are very important to Nama. In order for it to be a generally useful utility, I wanted it to be deployable in all types of situations. Nama doesn't contain any networking functionality, so it can be deployed in secure or offline locations without degradation in peformance or related security concerns.
